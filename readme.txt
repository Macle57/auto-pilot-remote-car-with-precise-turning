This code was orignally written for bussiness blasters with agriculturic needs in minds.
I have published the bare bone code that enables obstacle avoidance and remote controls, with addiditonal functinality of a gyro sensor, all turns are crisp 90*, regardless of terrain, battery power etc which might be concerned if powering the turning motor for fixed time which is very common in all the other basic programs.

DISCLAIMER: During the upload of code, disconnect the bluetooth sensor, and once its uploaded, connect it back to rx/tx pins of arduino (0,1).
