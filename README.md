This code was originally written for business blasters with agricultural needs in mind.
I have published the bare-bone code that enables obstacle avoidance and remote controls, with the additional functionality of a gyro sensor, all turns are crisp 90*, regardless of terrain, battery power etc which might be a concern if powering the 'turning motor' for fixed time which is very common in all the other basic programs.

DISCLAIMER: During the code upload, disconnect the Bluetooth sensor, and once it's uploaded, connect it back to the rx/tx pins of Arduino (0,1).
